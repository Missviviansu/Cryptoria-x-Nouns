![Cryptoria x Nouns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Missviviansu/Cryptoria-x-Nouns/main/Cryptoria%20x%20Nouns.png)

**Proposer**: Vivienne @ Cryptoria  
**Requested**: $8,800 USDC  
**Duration**: 4 months (November 2025 - February 2026)

## TL;DR

Cryptoria, the leading Chinese-language Web3 podcast with 12,000+ followers and 30,000+ monthly downloads, requests $8,800 to produce 6 in-depth episodes introducing Nouns DAO, CC0 culture, and Nounish values to Mandarin-speaking crypto professionals. As official media partner of all major crypto/FinTech events, we have privileged access to builders and exclusive interview opportunities. Our proven 47-82% completion rate (vs. 25-35% industry average) and cost-per-interaction of $0.13-$0.31 makes us the most effective channel for proliferating Nouns culture in the Chinese-speaking world. All content will be CC0.

## The Opportunity

**Chinese is the world's second-most spoken language** with 918 million native speakers. The Chinese-speaking Web3 community represents one of the world's largest crypto adoption regions, with high-net-worth professionals actively participating in NFT and DAO ecosystems.

**The Gap**: Despite previous investment in Chinese market expansion (Prop 211), there's no sustained Chinese content pipeline explaining Nouns governance, CC0 philosophy, and ecosystem values. Most resources are in English, and brief social media posts cannot convey the complexity of Nouns' innovative mechanisms.

**Why Podcasts**: 20-60 minute episodes provide sufficient depth to explain complex concepts, high engagement (our 47-82% completion rate), long-tail evergreen value, and multi-platform distribution reach.
